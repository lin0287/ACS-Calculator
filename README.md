# Aircraft Carrier Survival Calculator

The Aircraft Carrier Survival Calculator (ACS) is a tool designed to assist in selecting the optimal deck of cards for launching an attack. In the game Aircraft Carrier Survival, the choice of cards is crucial, as an incorrect selection can lead to mission failure. Conversely, choosing the right combination of cards can result in spectacular success. This project aims to develop a calculator that automatically selects the best cards based on the available choices.

## Key Features

- Adaptability: The calculator dynamically adapts to the user's card deck, ensuring the selection of the most effective cards.
- User Input: Users can specify the cards they possess, allowing the calculator to consider those options during the selection process.
- Advanced Considerations: Future updates will include the incorporation of opposing forces' capabilities and resource constraints, enhancing the accuracy of the card selection.
